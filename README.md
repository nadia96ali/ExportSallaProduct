#ExportSallaProduct

Export Salla products as an HTML page and an Excel file. This code is written in PHP, so it requires PHP installation, Composer, SallaOAuth, and PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet.

There are two versions: one with OAuth2 authentication and one without OAuth2 for test purposes.
The version without OAuth2 is suitable for users who save the Salla responses as separate JSON files,too.
